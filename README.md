Import the .mod files into a Kicad custom footprint folder:

--File â†’ Import Footprint from KiCad File. Select the .kicad_mod footprint file that you would like to use.
--Double click the imported footprint.
--Save the footprint to your project or global footprint library.

Note--footprints that come with Kicad are read only.
